## AI-Based Traffic and Speed Violation Detection System

This project implements an end-to-end **AI-based Traffic and Speed Violation Detection System** using:

- **YOLOv8** for vehicle detection
- **Speed estimation** from video frames
- **Red-light / stop-line violation detection**
- **OCR** for number plate recognition
- **MongoDB** for storing violation records
- **Flask** backend APIs
- **HTML/CSS/JS** frontend dashboard

> This README will be expanded as we progress through each phase of the project.

### Quick Start (after all phases are complete)

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies from `backend/requirements.txt`.
3. Configure your `.env` file (MongoDB URI, speed limit, etc.).
4. Run the Flask backend with `python run.py`.
5. Open the dashboard in your browser (default: `http://localhost:5000/dashboard` or similar route to be added later).
